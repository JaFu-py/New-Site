    <h1>Hey, I'm Jacob</h1>
    <p>@JaFu.py or @JaFupy</p>

    <p>I write code, dabble in blender, sometime make UIs in Figma. This website is a hobby of mine where I try new web dev stuff. Working on a <a href="www.jafu.dev/blog">blog</a>, and I might make a shop here too where I might sell digital goods. I live in southern England, but both my parents are Polish.<br><br>
        Take care now, bye bye! </p>
